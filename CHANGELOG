0.7.4	Fixed issue 12 (Compile error for ruby 1.9)

0.7.3	Fixed issue 10 (Compile Error in i486 Arch (-ldistorm64 not found) )

0.7.2	Fixed issue 9 by ruby-wrapping properly the rallhook thread info including the garbage collector mark function of 
		the ruby wrapper

		Removed hotfix of issue 9 improved in version 0.7.1, thread support restored

0.7.1	Fixed issue 9 ( http://github.com/tario/rallhook/issues#issue/9 ), "broken" object is processed by the GC due the impossibility of avoid 
		the deletion of an object of class Redirect returned by handle_method. The hotfix disabled the GC at each redirection and enable
		it again each time that a WRAPPER redirection concludes. Also the GC are re-enabled when the hook block is terminated. 
		
		MULTI-THREAD SUPPORT DISABLED
		This hotfix changes a flag, the global state of GC enabled. Due this flag is not by thread, concurrency executions of hook blocks
		in many thread simulaniously has unexpected and maybe undesirable behaviours
		
		The thread support will be added again to the next patch version 0.7.2

0.7.0	Concurrency support, any thread can hook without affect the hook state of the other threads

		Restrictions about overwrite instance methods disabled

		Added class shadows to confine the behaviour added throught methods to hook state

		Implemented UboundMethod#unchecked_bind to bind methods of different classes

0.6.1	Fixed bug on binding of class methods in Object#specific_method

0.6.0	Implemented method UboundMethod#body

		Improved compatibility of test cases with ruby1.9 and ruby1.8 behaviour

		Implemented Object#specific_method to lookup methods by klass and method_id

		Delete overload of Object#method

0.5.0	Security Improved: Restricted define of singleton methods over classes when hook is enabled

		Added special check for Object#binding to avoid change the binding behaviour with method redirection

		Security improved: Added hook of rb_add_method to avoid the overwriting of any method

		Security improved: Fixed leaks of hooking methods by making all methods called over Hook illegal if hook state is enabled

		More helpers to make easier to use. (see MethodHandler class)

		Documented methods and classes to generate useful RDoc
		
		Internal refactoring to split the logic of rallhook, hooking, method_handle invoke, etc... and the modification of the ruby interpreter with hook calls, etc...

0.4.1	Fixed bug in the hook module

0.4.0	Fixed bug in the version numbering

0.3.1	Added new method of intercept calls

		Changed interface of handlling of methods (see README and examples) to avoid errors in the handling of yield functions in ruby1.8

		New internal method of hook fixe many many bugs

		Fixed fastcall convention calls in i386, hooks and detection of calling convention

		Fixed compatibility issues with ruby1.8 and ruby1.9 in i386

		Rakefile configured to build extensions automatically at gem install

0.3.0:	Compatibility with ruby1.8 on i386 (tested with ruby 1.8.6 patchlevel 111 in ubuntu 8.04)		

		Compatibility with ruby1.9 on i386 (tested with ruby 1.9.0 in ubuntu 8.04)		

		Compatiblity with ruby1.8 on x86_64 (tested with ruby 1.8.7 patchlevel  72 in ubuntu 9.04)

		Compatibility with ruby1.9 on x86_64 (tested with ruby 1.9.0 r17482 in ubuntu 9.04)
		
		New method introspection features (see README for examples)
		

0.2.1:	Fixed issue #3: corrupted block arguments in hooking ( http://github.com/tario/rallhook/issues/issue/3 )

		Added testcase to test the issue #3

		Added some automatic tests of integrity of the modified interpreter

0.2.0:	Fixed RAII issues in RallHook::hook method

		Changed version of package to 0.2.0 to avoid "malformed" version number

0.2.0-rc1:	Added "TagContainer trick" to fix the issue #2: undesirable nest at super call with block  ( http://github.com/tario/rallhook/issues/issue/2 )

		Added klass parameter to hooked_send, fixing the issue #1: undesirable nest at super call ( http://github.com/tario/rallhook/issues/issue/1 )

		Added classes and methods to read method body info as the file and line where that method was defined
			obj.method(:foo).body.file
			obj.method(:foo).body.line
		

0.1.1:	Changed hooking and unhooking mechanism in the call of the handler of hooks
to make it internal at rallhooking (calling of hook and unhook from the call method are unnecesary now)

0.1.0:	implemented basic hooking as PoC of rallhook, basic example works fine
