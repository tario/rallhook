= rallhook - An ruby absolute method hooker

This package contains rallhook, a ruby C extension to intercept ruby methods calls at interpreter level in a transparent way from ruby itself.

== Installation

=== Prerequisites

* ruby-cymbol >= 0.1.0 (found at  http://github.com/tario/ruby-cymbol)


=== Gem installation

* Download the last version of the gem from http://github.com/tario/ruby-cpp/downloads
* Install the gem with the following;

gem install rallhook-X.X.X.gem

=== Ext installation

* Go to the gem install directory (Usually /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/rallhook-X.X.X )
* Run:

sudo rake install

== Usage

=== Basic Example

---- test.rb ----
class HookReceiver
	
	attr_accessor :rallhook
	
	def call (klass,self_,m,args, method_id)
	
		# print to the standar output details about the method called
		print "method call #{m}:#{method_id} over #{self_}:#{self_.class} args: #{args.inspect}\n" if m!=:write
		
		# in the call method, the hook is disabled and you can use whatever without hook
		# for this reason, we must to reactivate the hook to do nested calls to intercept calls made in that method
		
		ret = nil
		rallhook.from(2).hook self do
		
			# the hooked_send method is the same send method but doing unhook in yield calling
			# also, the hooked_send method allow method_id as method specification 
			# (some "internal" methods come with no method name by all the methods come with method_id )
			ret = self_.hooked_send(method_id,*args) do |*args_|
			
				# reactivate hook before call yield, this is necesary to intercept calls in the block passed to this method
				rallhook.hook self do
					yield(*args_)
				end
			end
		end
		
		ret
	end
end

hook_recv = HookReceiver.new
hook_recv.rallhook = RallHook.new

hook_recv.rallhook.hook hook_recv do
# all ruby calls in this block are intercepted by hook_recv::call 

[1,2,3].each do |x|
print x,"\n"
end

end
