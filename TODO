* RDoc documentation in the code
* Fix the leaks of hook to make it secure. 
ie: hooked_send from within hooked execution allow to escape the hook and invoque any method without hook
* More integrity testcases (with use of ruby core methods)
* new features of method instrospection testcases
* Security testcases (hook bypass checks,  security tests)
* Separate rallhook in two layers: the rallhook logic and ruby interface and the necesary logic to intercept the ruby calls
* Win32 compatibility
* Delete distorm dependency
* Delete libruby debuginfo dependency
* Make rallhook functionality transparent (backtraces, exceptions, etc ...)
